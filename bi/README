Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following (non-standard) Perl modules are required:

  * Carp::Assert,
  * Parse::Yapp,
  * Parse::Lex,
  * File::Slurp,
  * File::ShareDir,
  * Getopt::ArgvFile.

These can be installed using the "cpan" program available on most systems.
Simply type "install Template Math::Symbolic etc".

The following packages are required:

  * a C++ compiler,
  * GNU Autotools: autoconf and automake <www.gnu.org/software/>,

  * a BLAS implementation <www.netlib.org/blas/>,
  * a LAPACK implementation <www.netlib.org/lapack/>.

Note that you should install, where applicable, both the compiled libraries
and headers of these libraries; often the headers are available via separate
*-devel packages in the package manager of your Linux distribution.

For GPU support, the following additional packages are required:

  * CUDA 4.0 or later (including CUBLAS and CURAND) <www.nvidia.com/cuda>,
  * MAGMA 0.2 or later <icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/>.

models:

  * Doxygen <www.doxygen.org>,
  * dot,
  * graphviz,
  * pod2latex,
  * latex2html,
  * pdflatex.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install GenBi, simply place its files in any convenient location, and add
its bin/ directory to your PATH.


Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation of all Perl modules is available via perldoc, e.g.:

perldoc lib/Bi/Model.pm

The user manual may be built, from the base directory of Bi, using the command:

scripts/bi_make_user_docs

The HTML version of the manual may then be accessed at
docs/user/html/index.htm, and the LaTeX version at docs/user/tex/index.pdf

pdflatex index.tex
makeindex index
pdflatex index.tex
pdflatex index.tex

so as to produce the manual in the index.pdf file of that directory.

Source code documentation for LibBi may be built using doxygen with the
following command:

doxygen

HTML documentation can then be accessed at docs/dev/html/index.html.
