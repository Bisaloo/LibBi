LibBi Installation Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Specific instructions for Ubuntu Linux
* Specific instructions for Mac OS X


Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following non-standard Perl modules are required:

Template Graph Math::Symbolic Carp::Assert Parse::Yapp Parse::Lex File::Slurp
File::ShareDir Getopt::ArgvFile

These can be installed using the "cpan" program available on most systems.
After running "cpan", simply type "install Template Math::Symbolic ...".

The following packages are required:

  * a C++ compiler,
  * GNU Autotools: autoconf and automake <www.gnu.org/software/>,
  * Thrust 1.6 or later <thrust.github.com>,
  * NetCDF 4.0.1 or later <www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>,
  * QRUpdate <qrupdate.sourceforge.net>,
  * GNU Scientific Library <www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>,
  * Boost 1.43 or later, specifically Boost.Random and Boost.TypeOf
    <www.boost.org>,
  * a BLAS implementation <www.netlib.org/blas/>,
  * a LAPACK implementation <www.netlib.org/lapack/>.

Note that you should install, where applicable, both the compiled libraries
and headers of these libraries; often the headers are available via separate
*-devel packages in the package manager of your Linux distribution.

For GPU support, the following additional packages are required:

  * CUDA 5.0 or later (including CUBLAS and CURAND) <www.nvidia.com/cuda/>,
  * MAGMA 1.2.1 or later <icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/>.

For MPI support, the following additional packages are required:

  * An MPI implementation,
  * Boost.MPI and Boost.Serialization <www.boost.org>.

The following packages are optional for building documentation and visualising
models:

  * Doxygen <www.doxygen.org>,
  * dot,
  * graphviz,
  * pod2latex,
  * latex2html,
  * pdflatex.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once requirements are installed, LibBi is simply installed as a Perl
module. Use the following sequence:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will install LibBi for system-wide usage.


Specific instructions for Ubuntu Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install required packages:

sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libblas-dev libgsl0-dev gsl-bin \
    octave-gsl octave-statistics libqrupdate-dev libboost-all-dev \
    libnetcdf-dev ncview netcdf-bin octave-octcdf doxygen graphviz dot2tex \
    latex2html libtool libgsl0-dbg

Download Thrust from thrust.github.com, unzip and move the thrust/ directory
to /usr/local/include/thrust.

Install Perl modules:

    sudo cpan

then within cpan:

    install Template Math::Symbolic Carp::Assert Parse::Yapp Parse::Lex \
       File::Slurp File::ShareDir Getopt::ArgvFile

Finally, either install LibBi as a Perl module as in the generic instructions
above, or run it directly from a local directory with:

    /path/to/bi/script/bi ...

You can add /path/to/bi/script to your PATH variable in ~/.bashrc also, after
which you can just use the following from any directory:

    bi ...


Specific instructions for Mac OS X
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First ensure that you have Xcode installed. Launch it and use its Xcode >
Preferences menu item to install the "Command Line Tools" package. This will
give you some of the basics required by LibBi.

The remaining requirements can be satisfied from the MacPorts Project
<macports.org/>. The following step seems necessary on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain
Lion) or some MacPorts packages do not install:

    sudo xcodebuild -license

Now install required packages from MacPorts:

    sudo port install autoconf automake netcdf netcdf-cxx qrupdate atlas \
        boost gsl

This can take over an hour!

To ensure that LibBi can find the gfortran libraries, symlink them into the
/opt/local/lib directory as follows:

    sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/gcc45/libgfortran.a /opt/local/lib/.
    sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/gcc45/libgfortran.dylib /opt/local/lib/.

Download Thrust <thrust.github.com/>, unzip and move the thrust/ directory
to /opt/local/include/:

    sudo mv thrust /opt/local/include/.

Now install the required Perl modules:

    sudo cpan

then within cpan:

    install Template Math::Symbolic Carp::Assert Parse::Yapp Parse::Lex \
       File::Slurp File::ShareDir Getopt::ArgvFile

It is important that you do this *after* installing the MacPorts dependencies
above, otherwise the modules will be installed to the system default perl, not
MacPorts' perl.

Now, set up the environment for LibBi to compile its client programs. Firstly,
add the following to ~/.profile

    export LDFLAGS='-L/opt/local/lib'
    export CPPFLAGS='-I/opt/local/include'
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib
    export LD_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include

LibBi needs to use the MacPorts g++ compiler in /opt/local/bin, not the system
default g++ in /usr/bin. To do this, set the following environment variable:

    export CXX=/opt/local/bin/g++-mp-*

You can put this in ~/.profile too, although keep in mind that *any* configure
scripts that you run will then use this g++, not just LibBi. This may not be a
problem. If it is, just enter the above line each time you open a Terminal
window.

Quit Terminal then start it again, to ensure that these environment variables
are set.

Finally, either install LibBi as a Perl module as in the generic instructions
above, or run it directly from a local directory with:

    /path/to/bi/script/bi ...

You can add /path/to/bi/script to your PATH variable in ~/.profile also, after
which you can just use the following from any directory:

    bi ...
